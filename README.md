*Layout Optimization tool for a Hybrid Energy System*

### Description

Wind turbines have been extensively utilized to exploit wind energy both onshore and offshore. For offshore wind turbines, very strong supporting structures (i.e., pile, trusses, and mooring cables) should be used to ensure their safety under the actions of waves, currents, and winds. Among them, wave is a severe problem that should be solved properly to reduce its impact on the support structures. Before this, fixed-bottom breakwaters or floating breakwaters were employed to reduce incoming wave heights for the offshore wind turbines; however, wave energy was wasted during this process. Consequently, I am going to use wave energy converter to reduce incoming wave heights as well as to capture wave energy. Meanwhile, the layouts of the wind turbines and wave energy converters should be optimized to attain the largest energy output and the smallest wave loads of the support structure for wind turbines. This is the motivation for me to develop these tool (LOHES).
