*Layout Optimization tool for a Hybrid Energy System / 针对风能-波浪能耦合发电系统的布局优化工具*

### Description

​		Wind turbines have been extensively utilized to exploit wind energy both onshore and offshore. For offshore wind turbines, very strong supporting structures (i.e., pile, trusses, and mooring cables) should be used to ensure their safety under the actions of waves, currents, and winds. Among them, wave is a severe problem that should be solved properly to reduce its impact on the support structures. Before this, fixed-bottom breakwaters or floating breakwaters were employed to reduce incoming wave heights for the offshore wind turbines; however, wave energy was wasted during this process. Consequently, I am going to use wave energy converter to reduce incoming wave heights as well as to capture wave energy. Meanwhile, the layouts of the wind turbines and wave energy converters should be optimized to attain the largest energy output and the smallest wave loads of the support structure for wind turbines. This is the motivation for me to develop these tool (LOHES).

​		风机被广泛用于采集陆上和海上的风能。对海上风机来说，需要非常坚固的支撑结构（比如单桩、桁架或者锚链）来确保在波浪、势流以及风耦合作用下风机的安全。其中，波浪是一个比较严重的问题，需要恰当的措施来降低其对支撑结构的冲击作用。在此之前，固定式防波堤或是漂浮式防波堤已经被用于降低海上风机所处位置处的入射波高，但是，在这个过程中浪费了大量的波浪能量。因此，我期望使用波能转换器来降低波高并捕获波能。同时，为了获得最大的能量输出以及风机支撑结构的最小波浪荷载，需要对风机和波能转换器的布局进行优化，这也是我开发LOHES的目的。
